# Welcome to the GitHub Repository of Felix and Noah! 👋

This repository is part of our project for the course **Data Science and Machine Learning**, which we completed during our Master’s in **Sustainable Management and Technology**.

## 🌍 Project Question

**Are electric vehicles the saviors of the planet?**

To answer this, we conducted a comprehensive data analysis and statistical evaluation.

## 🎥 Summary Video

👉 Also, if you prefer reading and only have very limited time available: We’ve included a **60-second executive summary** of our findings directly in the repository for quick reference. You can find it [here](./Executive_summary.ipynb).

## 🧠 Technical Details

If you're curious about the technical side:

- Our Python script ([Code](./Code(1).ipynb)) contains the full analysis, including all package imports.
- It’s designed to run seamlessly in **Google Colab**.
- You can find it either in this repository or in the shared Google Drive folder.

## 📚 Further Resources

In the same Drive folder, you’ll also find:

- Our **slide deck**
- The **datasets** used for the analysis
- A curated collection of **relevant academic papers** to help you dive deeper into the topic
